Hello and welcome to my website. I am a [cyber security academic](https://www.ecu.edu.au/schools/science/staff/profiles/lecturers/dr-ahmed-ibrahim) at the Edith Cowan University ([ECU](https://www.ecu.edu.au/) [@EdithCowanUni](https://twitter.com/EdithCowanUni)), School of Science. I am the Course Coordinator for the Bachelor of Science ([Cyber Security](https://www.ecu.edu.au/degrees/courses/bachelor-of-science-cyber-security)) program. I teach and coordinate IoT and OT Security for Undergrads and Network Security for Postgrads. 

I am a researcher at the ECU Security Research Institute and my research is focused on tackling cyber security challenges in areas related to: 
* critical infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT), 
* cyber security risks in organisations, and 
* combating radicalisation in the cyber domain. 

I currently supervise several PhD students in these areas. If you are interested in doing a PhD/Masters (research) in any of these areas, feel free to get in touch with me. You can view my publications in my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=maVTmiQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Scopus profile](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55613229690). My ORCHID ID is [0000-0002-4760-3533](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4760-3533).

Some of my industry engagements include vulnerability assessments, security architecture reviews, security audits, website security assessments, desktop reviews, and risk assessments for the federal/state/local government and critical infrastructure providers.

I also volunteer at the [Quinns Beach Primary School](http://www.quinnsbeachps.wa.edu.au/) (School Board).
